== Description ==

Manage a music library within Wordpress; including playlists, tracks, artists, albums and live playlists.  It's the perfect fit for your music blog !

= Several new post types =
Tracks, artists, albums, playlists and live playlists uses each a custom post type, so you can easily manage them.

= MusicBrainz =
When managing a track, artist or album, the plugin can search for its MusicBrainz ID.
It makes it easier to identify the items, and loads various metadatas from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) (an open data music database).
For example, when creating an album post, you can load its tracklist from the MusicBrainz datas; so you don't need to enter each track manually.

= Playlists =
Create and manage tracklists easily with the Tracklist metabox.  Each entry added creates a new Track post.

Import a tracklist from a file or a music service like Spotify using the Tracklist Parser metabox.
Export playlists in [XSPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Shareable_Playlist_Format) (XML Shareable Playlist Format).

= Live Playlists =
The Tracklist Parser metabox allows you to enter the URL of a remote tracklist (eg. a Last.FM profile or a radio station tracklist) and to scrape its data.
The tracklist will be synced to the remote page, and tracks will be updated each time someone access the Live Playlist post.

For popular services like Spotify, no need to go any further.
But if the URL is not recognized, the advanced wizard will show up and you will need to enter some extra informations to get the tracklist data.
This requires to be somewhat familiar with [jQuery selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp).

NB : unlike playlists and albums, the Live Playlists tracklist entries are not stored as Track posts but as a post meta, to avoid creating too much posts over and over.

Optional arguments : *post_id*.

`[wpsstm-tracklist post_id="160"]`

= How can I display the tracklist of a post in my templates ? =

Use the tracklist shortcode **wpsstm-tracklist** in your post content (see the *shortcodes* section above), or use those functions directly in your templates :

$tracklist = wpsstm_get_post_tracklist(); //optionally accepts a post_id as argument
