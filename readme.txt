== Description ==

Manage a music library within Wordpress; including playlists, tracks, artists, albums and live playlists.  The perfect fit for your music blog !

= Several new post types =
Tracks, artists, albums, playlists and live playlists uses each a custom post type, so you can easily manage them.

= Playlists =

Managing the playlist tracks is a piece of cake using the Tracklist metabox :
Add or remove tracks on the fly, reorder them, and link one or several music sources to each track.

Import a tracklist from a file or a music service like Spotify using the Tracklist Importer (see below).
Export playlists in [XSPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Shareable_Playlist_Format) (XML Shareable Playlist Format).

= MusicBrainz =
When managing a track, artist or album, the plugin can search for its MusicBrainz ID.
It makes it easier to identify the items, and loads various metadatas from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) (an open data music database).
For example, when creating an album post, you can load its tracklist from the MusicBrainz datas; so you don't need to enter each track manually.

= Audio player =
When viewing a post that contains a tracklist, an audio player will show up to play your tracks !

The audio player uses the native [MediaElement.js](http://www.mediaelementjs.com/) media framework.
The current version that is shipped with Wordpress is obsolete; so you'll need to upgrade it manually (see [ticket#39686](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39686)).  It should be OK when Wordpress 4.8 is released.

Supported sources : regular audio files, Youtube, Soundcloud.

= Auto-source =
If you didn't set sources for your tracks (see below) and that the "auto-source" setting is checked; the audio player will try to find an online source automatically (Youtube, Soundcloud, ...) based on the track informations.

= Music Sources Metabox =
Set one or several music sources for your tracks when editing them; as on screenshot #8.
It could be a local audio file or a link to a music service.

Those links will be used by the audio player (see above) to play the track if the source URL is supported.

= Tracklist Importer Metabox =

Enter the URL of a tracklist (eg. a local XSPF file, a Spotify Playlist, a radio station page...) to scrape its data.

For popular services like Spotify or Radionomy, no need to go any further.
But if the URL is not recognized, the advanced wizard will show up and you will need to enter some extra informations to get the tracklist data.
This requires to be somewhat familiar with [jQuery selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp).

Native presets : Last.FM, Spotify, Radionomy, Deezer, SomaFM, BBC, Slacker, Soundcloud, Twitter, Soundsgood, Hype Machine.

= Live Playlists =

(disabled by default, you can enable them by acessing the plugin's settings page)

Live Playlists lets you grab a tracklist from a remote URL (eg. a radio station page) using the Tracklist Importer (see above).
The tracklist will stay synchronized with its source : it will be updated each time someone access the Live Playlist post.

Demo on [spiff-radio.org](http://www.spiff-radio.org/?post_type=wpsstm_live_playlist).

You may also propose a Frontend Tracklist Importer to your visitors. 
They will be able to use it to get a remote tracklist; which could be useful for backups or to load a tracklist in a software like [Tomahawk](https://www.tomahawk-player.org/).
Just create a blank page and set its ID for the *Frontend wizard page ID* field in the plugin settings page.

Demo on [spiff-radio.org](http://www.spiff-radio.org/?p=213).

= Shortcodes =

`[wpsstm-track post_id="150"]`

To embed the single track #150.
Optional arguments : *post_id*.

`[wpsstm-tracklist post_id="160"]`

To embed the tracklist from the post #160.  
Works for albums, playlists and live playlists.
Optional arguments : *post_id*,*max_rows*.

= Post Bookmarks plugin =
If the [Post Bookmarks plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-bookmarks/) is enabled, links from MusicBrainz will be suggested in the Post Bookmarks metabox.

= Donate! =
It truly took me a LOT of time to code this plugin, and I decided to release it for free - without any "Premium" plans.
If you like it, please consider [making a donation](http://bit.ly/gbreant).
This would be very appreciated â€” Thanks !

= Dependencies =

* [phpQuery](https://github.com/punkave/phpQuery) - a PHP port of jQuery selectors

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your blog and Activate it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I display the tracklist of a post in my templates ? =

Use the tracklist shortcode **[wpsstm-tracklist]** in your post content (see the *shortcodes* section above), or use those functions directly in your templates :

`<?php
$tracklist = wpsstm_get_post_tracklist(); //optionally accepts a post_id as argument
echo $tracklist->get_tracklist_table();
?>`

= How can I alter the music sources for a track ? =
Hook a custom function on the filter *wpsstm_get_track_sources_db* or *wpsstm_get_track_sources_remote*.

* use *wpsstm_get_track_sources_db* when populating sources from your database
* use *wpsstm_get_track_sources_remote* when populating sources from a remote URl - like an API (slower and thus requested through ajax).

`<?php
function my_filter_get_source_db($sources,$track){
    //...your code here...
    return $sources;
}
add_filter('wpsstm_get_track_sources_db','my_filter_get_source_db',10,2);
?>`

= Standalone tracks vs Subtracks vs Live Playlist tracks ? =

Playlist and Albums tracks are saved as Track posts.  
The playlist / album will have a post meta *wpsstm_subtrack_ids* that contains an array of ordered track IDs.  It is what we call "subtracks" in the plugin's code.

Unlike playlists and albums, the Live Playlists tracks are not stored as Track posts but as a [transient](https://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API), to avoid creating too much posts over and over.  The name of that transient starts with *wpsstm_ltracks_*.
